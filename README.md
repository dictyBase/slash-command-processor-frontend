# slash-command-processor-frontend

Storage for any slash command-based (chatops) GitHub workflows used for frontend web applications.

## Commands

**`/deploy`**

Deploys web application to a specified cluster.

### Examples

**Posting a comment inside an issue:**  
`/deploy cluster=erickube commit=xyz`  
`/deploy cluster=erickube branch=develop`

**Posting a comment inside a pull request:**  
`/deploy cluster=siddkube`  
`/deploy cluster=siddkube commit=xyz`

_If no commit is given in a PR comment, the head commit is used._

Repositories that use this command need to include a GitHub workflow that runs on issue comment
creation ([example](https://github.com/dictyBase/publication/blob/develop/.github/workflows/chatops.yml)).
